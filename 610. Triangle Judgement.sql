-- CASE statement is for conditional logic
-- It adds a derived column to output not to the database
-- Conditions are matched from top to bottom (first matching WHEN wins)
-- ELSE is optional (returns NULL if omitted)
-- Should give an alias to the column being derived (query runs fine without it but the auto-generated name would be ugly)
-- Make sure to put a comma before CASE, since CASE adds the last item of SELECT statement
-- Indentation is not mandatory but strongly encouraged for readability
